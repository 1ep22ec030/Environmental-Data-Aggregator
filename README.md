# Project Title
## Environmental Data Aggregator with Raspberry Pi and GCP

---

## Project Description
This project collects environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality and sends it to the cloud for monitoring and analysis. The system uses cloud services to simulate real-time data transmission and visualization.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how IoT devices can send environmental data to cloud platforms for smart city and environmental monitoring applications.
